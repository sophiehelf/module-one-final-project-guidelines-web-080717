# Module One Final Project: Restaurant Suggester

# Welcome to Restaurant Suggester! 

Restaurant Suggester is a small application that uses the Zomato Api to suggest restaurants in the New York City area based on which cuisine you're interested in. It pulls data from the API to generate "restaurant cards" - not unlike Tinder profiles â€“ that include the name of the restaurant, its location, address, aggregate rating, website, and price range. 

Users create a profile upon opening the app and can decide whether to choose more restaurants or look over the restaurants they've said yes to. When a user "swipes" yes on a restaurant, it's saved to their profile and they can then go back and look at its "restaurant card" whenever they choose to.
